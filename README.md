SNAKE GAME
Snake-Game-Cpp is a classic snake game implemented in C++. The game allows players to control a snake and try to eat food items while avoiding colliding with its own body or the game's boundaries. The game's objective is to survive as long as possible while accumulating points for every food item the snake consumes.

INSTALLATION
To run the game, you must first clone the repository to your computer.
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and compile the source code using a C++ compiler like Dev-C++. Once the code has been compiled, you can execute the game by running the generated executable file.

USAGE
To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake. The objective of the game is to eat as many food items as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game's boundaries. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows in size, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.

The game ends when the snake collides with its own body or the game's boundaries. Your score is displayed on the screen, and you have the option to restart the game or quit.
